## Project Overview

Each project in this repository aims to solve real-world data challenges and demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, statistical techniques, and machine learning models. The projects are implemented in Python, using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and TensorFlow.

### Key Projects:

1. **Time Series Analysis**: Explore and forecast trends in time-based data.
2. **Predicting Fare Price**: Build a predictive model to estimate fare prices based on factors such as distance and demand.
3. **Password Strength using NLP**: Analyze password strength using Natural Language Processing.
4. **Vehicle Detection using Deep Learning**: Use Convolutional Neural Networks to detect vehicles in images.
5. **NBA 3-pointer & 4-pointer Line**: Analyze NBA data for 3-point shooting efficiency and trends.
6. **Customer Segmentation Engine**: Implement a clustering model to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
7. **Data Science Salary Analysis**: Visualize trends in data science salaries based on region, experience, and skills.
8. **EDA on Finance Data**: Perform exploratory data analysis on financial datasets to uncover key insights.
9. **Movie Recommender System**: Build a recommendation system for movie suggestions.
10. **Global Cost of Living**: Analyze global cost-of-living data and create visualizations.

## Installation
